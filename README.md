**Google DevFest Group 7 Project: Food Waste Management Website**

By Thomas, Deeni, Ameera and Aria

--------------------------------------------------------------

This project provides a website in which the user takes inventory of their food and charts what else they can buy to make efficient recipes. This is done with the aim of minimising food leftovers and therefore minimising the amount of product that would otherwise release methane into the atmosphere when left to landfill.

The website boasts a sleek design as well as a feature to indicate local food bank. They redistribute excess food to those less fortunate, as well as boast educational/awareness initiatives.
